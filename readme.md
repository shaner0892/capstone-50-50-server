# 50/50

50/50 is my server-side capstone project for Nashville Software School. As an avid traveler I have always made it a goal to travel to all 50 of the 50 states. This app allows users keep a log of their own trips and also plan for future ones. When they add a trip to their profile they can add activities, pictures, and a rating. Users can browse through all other users' trips to see the highest rated activities and destinations as a way to get inspired for their next adventure.

## Technologies Used

The client-side of this app is built with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Reactstrap. The server-side is built with Python and Django.
